Experiences

During these weeks of intense labour and hard work we’ve learned alot about concurrency, but more about this specific piece of software, it would seem. When we started this project, our first concern was the design. The design went through several different stages before we were pleased with it, and even so, we ended up changing it again a few times, but the final iteration is actually a lot like the one we first came up with, in terms of what classes that are used and their dependencies. 
Our second concern was regarding the protocol translation. We first thought about making the translation process in a separate class, but ended up performing in the respective models. We really didn’t put much thought about why, it just kind of happend, and we were happy with the results. 

If we were to start the project today, with our newfound knowledge, we would probably have spent more time on the GUI. As it is today, it is functional, but it isn’t particularly well structured. The main strength of our GUI is that it is possible for it to handle more than two windows (we tested three windows and suffered virtually no decrease in performance).
